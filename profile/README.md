## 🧠 What Are Mage Arena Cheat Tools?

**Cheat tools** are external scripts, injectors, or mod menus that hook into the game and give you advanced powers. They let you bend the rules—change how spells work, eliminate cooldowns, boost XP gain, freeze enemies, or even fly around the arena.

Some are lightweight one-function mods (like infinite mana), while others are full mod menus with dozens of toggles. Either way, they let you **skip the boring parts** and dive straight into domination.
